#Linear Regression(Math)

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable 
𝑌
Y and one or more independent variables 
𝑋
X. It assumes a linear relationship between these variables

##Simple Linear Regression(ep):
    `y=c+mx`

* y = dependent variable (output)
* x = independent variable (input)
* m = slope of the line (regression coefficient)
* c = intercept (constant)

The goal is to find the best values of m and c that minimize the error.

## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and *multiple* independent variables.  Instead of a single predictor (x), we now have a set of predictors (x₁, x₂, x₃, ... xₙ).  The equation representing this relationship is:

`y = c + m₁x₁ + m₂x₂ + m₃x₃ + ... + mₙxₙ`

Where:

*   y = dependent variable (output)
*   x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ = independent variables (inputs, features)
*   m₁, m₂, m₃, ..., mₙ = slopes of the line (regression coefficients) representing the effect of each independent variable on y
*   c = intercept (constant) representing the value of y when all independent variables are zero.
