#Linear Regression(Math)

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable 
𝑌
Y and one or more independent variables 
𝑋
X. It assumes a linear relationship between these variables

##Simple Linear Regression(ep):
    `y=c+mx`

* y = dependent variable (output)
* x = independent variable (input)
* m = slope of the line (regression coefficient)
* c = intercept (constant)

The goal is to find the best values of m and c that minimize the error.
